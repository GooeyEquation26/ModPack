This is an easy to use server setup for Unlimited Entertainment.

To run the server you can either run the forge jar file, this allows for a GUI version of the server console.
You can also run the ServerStart.bat to run a nogui version of the console. I have found that the nogui version seems
to be a little bit more stable(less likely to crash)

A couple of settings need to be changed in order to run the server.

Accept the eula by changing the false value -> true

After running the server for the first time, close the server, open the server.properties, and change the 
level-type=default -> level-type=biomesop, This will allow you to generate a Biomes o' Plenty world for your server

Congradulations! You have a server!
